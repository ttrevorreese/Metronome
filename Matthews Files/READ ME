In order for these files to work the extract.py needs to be ran first

it will create two things
  1. a databse with all of the songs in
  2. a text file with all of the song ids in
  
once this has been done the playlist file can be done

this will do the following
  1. read the text file to radnomly select a song id to be used as a seed
  2. create 50 reccomendations based off of the seen song
  3. make a playlist wiht all of the reccomendations inside of it
